The job is failing due to multiple issues, primarily related to missing files and network errors for localhost URLs. Here are the steps to resolve these issues:

1. **Fix Missing Files**:
   Ensure the following files are present or update the references if the paths have changed:
   - `genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts`
   - `genkit/postcard-generator/docs/libs/genkit/schema.ts`
   - `genkit/postcard-generator/docs/libs/genkit/flows.ts`
   - `genkit/postcard-generator/.env`
   - `genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts/postcard-map.prompt`
   - `genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts/_example-highlights.prompt`
   - `genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts/postcard-image.prompt`
   - `gemini/sample-apps/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack/tests/load_test/cicd/cd/staging.yaml`
   - `gemini/sample-apps/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack/app/app/utils/tracing.py`
   - `gemini/knowledge-engine`
   - `gemini/sample-apps/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack/app/patterns/agentic_rag_vertex_ai_search/pattern_setup/resources_to_copy/app/patterns/agentic_rag_vertex_ai_search/README.md`

2. **Update URLs**:
   Replace localhost URLs with valid external URLs or mock them in the testing environment:
   - `http://localhost:8000/`
   - `http://localhost:4000/`
   - `http://localhost:3000/`
   - `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html`
   - `http://localhost:8080/`
   - `http://localhost:8501/`

3. **Fix Network and Certificate Errors**:
   Review your network settings and ensure the certificate issues are resolved. For URLs that need to be accessed securely, make sure valid SSL certificates are configured.

4. **Resolve Broken Links**:
   - Update or remove the broken link: [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dialogflow-ccai-omnichannel](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dialogflow-ccai-omnichannel)

Here is a sample code snippet to handle missing files in the documentation process:

```python
import os

required_files = [
    'genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts',
    'genkit/postcard-generator/docs/libs/genkit/schema.ts',
    'genkit/postcard-generator/docs/libs/genkit/flows.ts',
    'genkit/postcard-generator/.env',
    'genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts/postcard-map.prompt',
    'genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts/_example-highlights.prompt',
    'genkit/postcard-generator/docs/prompts/postcard-image.prompt',
    'gemini/sample-apps/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack/tests/load_test/cicd/cd/staging.yaml',
    'gemini/sample-apps/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack/app/app/utils/tracing.py',
    'gemini/knowledge-engine',
    'gemini/sample-apps/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack/app/patterns/agentic_rag_vertex_ai_search/pattern_setup/resources_to_copy/app/patterns/agentic_rag_vertex_ai_search/README.md'
]

missing_files = [file for file in required_files if not os.path.exists(file)]

if missing_files:
    for file in missing_files:
        print(f"Missing file: {file}")
        # Handle the missing file, e.g., create it, fetch it from a remote source, etc.
else:
    print("All required files are present.")
```

Implement these changes and re-run the job to ensure the issues are resolved.
